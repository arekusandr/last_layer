# Last Layer - Features for Organizations

This feature list outlines the advanced capabilities of LastLayer to assist in integrating high-security, low-latency language model applications into organizational infrastructure, with a particular focus on detecting and preventing prompt injection and jailbreak attempts.

## 1. Advanced Data Privacy

The library is engineered to eliminate external API calls, safeguarding sensitive information.

## 2. Ultra-Low Latency Real-time Queries

Achieves millisecond query responses even with extensive prompts, enabling real-time interaction without compromise.

## 3. Exclusive Pentest with a 40k Jailbreak Dataset

Private pentesting services using an exclusive dataset of 40,000 jailbreak attempts, ensuring unparalleled security and prompt injection prevention.

## 4. Unique Threat Vector Identification

Identifies and mitigates unique threat vectors, providing a tailored security posture against sophisticated attacks.

## 5. Continuous Feedback and LLMOps Integration

Implements feedback loops and LLMOps for continuous monitoring and improvement, ensuring optimal performance and security.

## 6. Reduced dependencies

Self-Contained Runtime Environment: LastLayer operates within a self-contained runtime. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for organizations by minimizing the complexity typically associated with setting up and maintaining LLM applications and infra.

This library approach not only simplifies the architecture but also reduces potential points of failure and latency issues associated with external dependencies
