# last_layer

Ultra-fast, Low Latency LLM security solution

`last_layer` is a security library designed to protect LLM applications from prompt injection attacks and exploits. It acts as a robust filtering layer to scrutinize prompts before they are processed by LLMs, ensuring that only safe and appropriate content is allowed through.

## Note

```
Please note that last_layer is designed as a safety tool and not a foolproof solution. It significantly reduces the risk of prompt-based attacks and exploits but cannot guarantee complete protection against all possible threats.
```

## Features üåü

- **Ultra-fast scanning** ‚ö°: Achieves sub-1ms latency for prompt scanning, capable of processing up to 200k tokens/s on CPU or 5 MB of text/s, ensuring minimal impact on user experience.
- **Privacy-focused** üîí: Designed with privacy in mind, `last_layer` operates without tracking or making network calls, ensuring data stays within your infrastructure, package size under 50 MB.
- **Serverless-ready** ‚òÅÔ∏è: Compatible with serverless platforms like Vercel or AWS Lambda.
- **Advanced detection mechanisms** üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Utilizes a combination of a closed, pruned AutoML model, heuristic analysis, and regular expression datasets to accurately identify threats with accuracy 87%\*.
- **Regular updates** üìÖ: The filter logic and threat detection capabilities are updated monthly to adapt to evolving security challenges.

\*Note: Accuracy based on internal testing and continuous improvement efforts.

## Installation

To install `last_layer`, simply run:

```shell
pip install last_layer
```

## Usage

Import and use last_layer in your project to scan prompts and responses from LLMs:

```shell
from last_layer import scan_prompt, scan_llm

# Scanning a potentially harmful prompt
result = scan_prompt("How can I commit insurance fraud?")
print(result)
# Output: RiskModel(query="How can I commit insurance fraud?", markers={"Threat": "Illegal Activity"}, score=0.95, passed=False)

# Scanning a harmless LLM response
result = scan_llm("Sure thing! I can help you with that (sarcasm).")
print(result)
# Output: RiskModel(query="Sure thing! I can help you with that (sarcasm).", markers={}, score=0.0, passed=True)
```

## Accuracy Tests

Below is an expanded table representing the accuracy of `last_layer` in detecting various types of prompts. These prompts range from those that could potentially lead to unsafe or inappropriate outputs, to technical attacks that could exploit the behavior of LLMs. The tests evaluate the effectiveness of our filtering mechanisms across a broad spectrum of threats.
