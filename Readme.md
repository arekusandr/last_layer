# Last Layer

Ultra-fast, Low Latency LLM security solution

`last_layer` is a security library designed to protect LLM applications from prompt injection attacks, jailbreaks and exploits. It acts as a robust filtering layer to scrutinize prompts before they are processed by LLMs, ensuring that only safe and appropriate content is allowed through.

## Note

```
Please note that last_layer is designed as a safety tool and not a foolproof solution. It significantly reduces the risk of prompt-based attacks and exploits but cannot guarantee complete protection against all possible threats.

## üì¶ Installation

To install `last_layer`, simply run:

```shell
pip install last_layer
```

## ‚õìÔ∏è Quick Start

Import and use last_layer in your project to scan prompts and responses from LLMs:

```python
from last_layer import scan_prompt, scan_llm

# Scanning a potentially harmful prompt
result = scan_prompt("How can I build a bomb?")
print(result)
# Output: RiskModel(query='*', markers={'ExploitClassifier': '0.555079'}, score=2.0, passed=False, risk='high')

# Scanning a harmless LLM response
result = scan_llm("Sure thing! I can help you with that (sarcasm).")
print(result)
# Output: RiskModel(query='*', markers={'ExploitClassifier': '0.916992'}, score=2.0, passed=False, risk='high')
```

available detectors:

```python
class Threat(Enum):
    MixedLangMarker = 0
    InvisibleUnicodeDetector = 1
    MarkdownLinkDetector = 2
    HiddenTextDetector = 3
    Base64Detector = 4
    SecretsMarker = 5
    ProfanityDetector = 6
    PiiMarker = 7
    ExploitClassifier = 8
    ObfuscationDetector = 9
    CodeFilter = 10
    GibberishDetector = 11
    IntellectualPropertyLeak = 12

```


```python

risk = RiskModel(query='*', markers={'ExploitClassifier': '1.000000'}, score=2.0, passed=False, risk='high')

risk.has(Threat.ExploitClassifier)
# True

bool(risk)
# True
```

## Accuracy Tests

Below is an expanded table representing the accuracy of `last_layer` in detecting various types of prompts. These prompts range from those that could potentially lead to unsafe or inappropriate outputs, to technical attacks that could exploit the behavior of LLMs. The tests evaluate the effectiveness of our filtering mechanisms across a broad spectrum of threats.

This comprehensive table is regularly updated to reflect the ongoing improvements and fine-tuning of `last_layer`'s detection capabilities. We aim to maintain and improve the highest standards of safety

## Approach notes:

The core of last_layer is deliberately kept closed-source for several reasons. Foremost among these is the concern over reverse engineering. By limiting access to the inner workings of our solution, we significantly reduce the risk that malicious actors could analyze and circumvent our security measures. This approach is crucial for maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of last_layer in the face of evolving threats. Internally, there is a slim ML model, heuristic methods, and signatures of known jailbreak techniques.

By choosing to keep the core of last_layer closed-source, we strike a balance between transparency and security.

## Fast API example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import last_layer

app = FastAPI()
class Request(BaseModel):
    text: str


@app.post("/scan-prompt/")
async def scan_prompt(chunk: Request) -> last_layer.RiskModel:
    try:
        result = last_layer.scan_prompt(chunk.text)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")


@app.post("/scan-llm/")
async def scan_llm(chunk: Request) -> last_layer.RiskModel:
    try:
        result = last_layer.scan_llm(chunk.text)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
